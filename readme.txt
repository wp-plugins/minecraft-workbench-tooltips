Easily turn links to Minecraft items into fancy pop-out tooltips. 

== Description ==

Easily turn links to Minecraft items into fancy pop-out tooltips. Simply link to the relevant item's page on http://www.minecraftwb.com/ and the script will do the rest. 

Caches data locally to minimise data transfer. 

Will eventually add the ability to link by item name through a shortcode, like [mcwb:Diamond Pick] or similar.

== Installation ==

1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

The "cache" directory needs to be writable by the web process, which should be the case by default. 

== Screenshots ==

1. After locating the item's url on http://www.minecraftwb.com/ - link to it using an ordinary hyperlink.
2. Moooo!
3. Noooo!
